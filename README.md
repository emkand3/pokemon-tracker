###### POKEMON TRACKER ######

The Pokemon tracker is a tracking system used to help keep track of what pokemon cards one needs and what card packs they
should buy to help complete their collection.

There is no distinction of card type in this system, only distinction of pokemon (ex: there is no difference between a
reverse Pikachu card and a normal one).

The card tracker can currently perform 5 different functions:
  1. List Pokemon: This action will list all of the pokemon the current user has left to collect.
  2. Best Pack: This action will show the pack that would be most beneficial to buy, based on number of Pokemon left in that pack.
  3. Top 3 Best/Worst: This action will display the three packs with the most new Pokemon available, and the three packs with the
     least amount of pokemon available.
  4. Delete Pokemon: This action is used to delete a Pokemon from the list of Pokemon left to collect. In other words, when a user
     collects a card that they previously needed, they will use this function to delete it from the list of needed cards.
  5. Pokemon per Pack: This action will display the Pokemon that the user does not have that are available in the pack.
